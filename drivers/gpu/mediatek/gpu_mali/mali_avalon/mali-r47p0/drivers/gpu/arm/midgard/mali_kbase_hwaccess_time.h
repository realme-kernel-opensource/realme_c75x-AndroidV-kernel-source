 * According to Generic timer spec, system timer:
 * - Increments at a fixed frequency
 * - Starts operating from zero
 *
 * Hence CPU time is a linear function of System Time.
 *
 * CPU_ts = alpha * SYS_ts + beta
 *
 * Where
 * - alpha = 10^9/SYS_ts_freq
 * - beta is calculated by two timer samples taken at the same time:
 *   beta = CPU_ts_s - SYS_ts_s * alpha
 *
 * Since alpha is a rational number, we minimizing possible
 * rounding error by simplifying the ratio. Thus alpha is stored
 * as a simple `multiplier / divisor` ratio.
